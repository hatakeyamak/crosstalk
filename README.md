# crosstalk

## overview

### about
crosstalk is an application which simulates error-causing phenomena in Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs).

It was developed by Andrew Baas and Jordan Potarf to help visualize SiPMs during the CMS HCAL Phase I HF upgrade, in which the HCAL will be upgraded from Hybrid Photodiodes (HPDs) to SiPMs.

### key features

### results
we hope to compare the results from crosstalk across various parameters to CMSSW's standard SiPM simulation

### active development
crosstalk is currently under development and we will be releasing version 1.0 soon.
